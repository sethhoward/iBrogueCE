Brogue CE for iPad OS
=====================

*Brogue* is a single-player strategy game set in the halls of a mysterious
and randomly-generated dungeon. The objective is simple enough -- retrieve the
fabled Amulet of Yendor from the 26th level -- but the dungeon is riddled with
danger. Horrifying creatures and devious, trap-ridden terrain await. Yet it is
also riddled with weapons, potions, and artifacts of forgotten power. Survival
demands strength and cunning in equal measure as you descend, making the most
of what the dungeon gives you. You will make sacrifices, narrow escapes,
and maybe even some friends along the way -- but will you be one of the
lucky few to return alive?

Playing
-------

To run the iPad OS app, just start the app as usual. If you have an attached
keyboard, either one directly connected or one connected via Bluetooth, you can
use that in addition to on-screen touches to control your rogue, or to enter
commands.   

The first screen shows an initial menu.  


### Seeds

If you choose to start a New Seeded Game, you will be prompted to enter a number, used as a "seed" to create the dungeon and its contents.
Each numeric seed guarantees the dungeon will be the same as someone else using the same seed.
This allows competitions where every player enters the same dungeon layout, and sees
how far they can get before dying. Check out the Reddit forum (in Resources) for contest information.


### In-game movement and screen touches

The "compass rose" figure on the left lower side of the screen can be used to
direct your rogue by tapping or holding down one "arrow" of the compass in the
direction you wish to move. Also, you can touch the game screen directly. A
screen touch will first highlight a path to a location, showing what is there,
and then when confirmed with another touch your rogue will follow the path. If
you need to cancel an action, drag your finger till it highlights your rogue,
then lift it off safely.

<br>
If you are using an attached keyboard, Vi/Nethack keyboard movements (i.e.
h,j,k,l,y,u,b,n) may be used in addition to the "compass rose".  Arrow keys and
the keypad arrows are also accepted.

The keywords along the bottom are also touch sensitive.

### Brogue CE : iPad Edition
This iPad Edition of BrogueCE (Brogue Community Edition) continues a port first
made available by @sethhoward. This port takes work that @tmewett did for
advancing the Brogue game on the PC, Mac, and Linux systems, and makes it run
under iPad OS. 

### What is Community Edition?

Brogue was created by Brian Walker. This version, *Brogue: Community Edition*,
is a continuation of its development. It has several main goals:

- fix bugs and crashes
- add useful quality of life and non-gameplay features
- improve the gameplay and keep it exciting
- ease development and maintenance
- be a convenient base for forks and ports to new platforms

### How is CE different from the original Brogue?

Please refer to the changelog or release history for a complete list. There is
also a wiki page: [Changes from original][cfo].

### How is the project run, and how are changes decided?

This iPad OS port is maintained by @btaylor84, with input and assistance from @sethhoward
and @tmewett.

The project is run with a "benevolent dictator" model, with @tmewett in
charge. There are many other testers and regular contributors; see the
contribution guide to get involved!

We always try to make changes in the same spirit as the rest of the game. Anyone
can propose a change - all discussion occurs in our GitHub issue tracker or on
our development Discord (see CONTRIBUTING.md). We also make sure that things are
well play-tested.
